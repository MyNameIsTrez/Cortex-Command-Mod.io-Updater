# Cortex-Command-Mod.io-Updater

Scripts used for downloading, converting, testing, and updating all [Cortex Command Community Project mods](https://mod.io/g/cccp/) automatically.

It is highly recommended that you drop `Benchmark.rte` from [my mod repository](https://github.com/MyNameIsTrez/Cortex-Command-Mods) into your game's `Mods/` directory, as it is ran for 60 seconds to verify nothing gets printed to the console, nor any crashes occur.
